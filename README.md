## üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Intro

Reibo was built with the user in mind using <a href="https://reactjs.org/"><b>React</b></a>. Reibo allows users to view articles written and socialise based on the individuals interest. All styling was self performed using CSS and no UI kits were utilised. Inspirations for the app can be found in social media giants like reddit and facebook. For UI design, the inspiration was taken from the apple website and the whatsapp app.
